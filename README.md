### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a data analyst with a degree in Health Information Management. My primary areas of interest are...

I am a [Registered Health Information Technician](https://www.ahima.org/certification/RHIT) (`RHIT`), [Certified Professional Coder](https://www.aapc.com/certifications/cpc) (`CPC`), and [Certified Physician Practice Manager](https://www.aapc.com/certifications/cppm) (`CPPM`).

In a previous life, I was a [graphic designer](https://www.behance.net/andybruce1).
