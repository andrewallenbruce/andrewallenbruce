### Hi there ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a data analyst with a degree in Health Information Management.

I am a [Registered Health Information Technician](https://www.ahima.org/certification/RHIT), [Certified Professional Coder](https://www.aapc.com/certifications/cpc), and [Certified Physician Practice Manager](https://www.aapc.com/certifications/cppm).

In a previous life, I earned a [BFA](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bachelor_of_Fine_Arts) in studio art and was a [graphic designer](https://www.behance.net/andybruce1) for 15 years.
